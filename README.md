## Overview
The electricity energy monitor uses the PZEM-004T sensor to measure voltage, current, power, and energy consumption. The ESP32 processes this data and sends it to an online platform like Blynk for remote monitoring <button class="citation-flag" data-index="4">. This project helps users track their energy usage and make informed decisions to reduce consumption.

## Components Used
To build this electricity energy monitor, you will need the following components:
- **ESP32 Development Board**
- **PZEM-004T Power Meter**
- **0.96" I2C OLED Display (Optional)**
- **5V USB Power Adapter**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard (Optional)**

## System Dimensions
For an ideal electricity energy monitor:
- **Height**: 10â€“15 cm
- **Width**: 10â€“15 cm
- **Length**: 10â€“15 cm

These dimensions ensure that the system is compact yet spacious enough to house all components.

## Assembly Instructions
Follow these steps to assemble your electricity energy monitor:
1. Connect the PZEM-004T sensor to the ESP32.
2. Optionally, connect an OLED display for local monitoring.
3. Power the system using a USB cable.
4. Secure all components inside a protective enclosure.

## Arduino Code Explanation
The provided Arduino code reads data from the PZEM-004T sensor and sends it to the Blynk platform for remote monitoring. The code also displays the data on the Serial Monitor for debugging purposes.

---

## How to Test Without Simulation
1. Upload the code to the ESP32 using a USB cable.
2. Test the PZEM-004T sensor by checking the Serial Monitor for readings.
3. Set up the Blynk app and verify that the data is displayed correctly on the dashboard.
